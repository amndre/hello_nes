# Boilerplate NES program in 6502 assembly

Heavily based on the [Nerdy Nights](https://nerdy-nights.nes.science/#main_tutorial-0)
tutorial on making NES games.

To compile this project you will need the [NESASM3](https://github.com/camsaul/nesasm) assembler.

To compile the program, run:

    nesasm hello_nes.asm

This will generate a hopefully funcitonal .nes file that can be run by an emulator like [FCEUX](https://github.com/TASEmulators/fceux).
